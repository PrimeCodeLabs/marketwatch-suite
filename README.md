# MarketWatch Suite

## Introduction

The **MarketWatch Suite** is a microservices-based application designed to demonstrate and explore the capabilities of gRPC for interservice communication. This project includes three main services:

- **Stock Data Service**: Manages and provides stock market data.
- **Alert Processing Service**: Processes alerts based on specific stock market conditions.
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications to users based on the alerts generated by the Alert Processing Service.

The architecture is designed to leverage gRPC for efficient, robust, and type-safe communication between the services.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **`/services`**: Contains the individual service applications, including their source code and Dockerfiles.
- **`/proto`**: Houses the Protocol Buffers definitions used by gRPC to define the structure of the data and the format of the service APIs.
- **`/docker`**: Includes Dockerfiles for building containerized versions of each service.

### Services

Each service in the `/services` directory has its own sub-directory:

- **`stock-data-service`**
- **`alert-processing-service`**
- **`notification-service`**

### Proto Definitions

Shared Protocol Buffers definitions are located in the `/proto` directory. These files define the gRPC service APIs and message formats.

### Docker Configuration

The `/docker` directory contains Dockerfiles for each service, supporting containerization and simplifying deployment and testing.

## Setup and Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PrimeCodeLabs/marketwatch-suite
   ```
2. Build the Docker containers for each service (ensure Docker is installed)
   docker build -t stock-data-service ./docker/Dockerfile-stock
   docker build -t alert-processing-service ./docker/Dockerfile-alert
   docker build -t notification-service ./docker/Dockerfile-notification

3. Run the services:
   docker run stock-data-service
   docker run alert-processing-service
   docker run notification-service

### Learning Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to learn about gRPC and its applications in microservices architectures. Key learning points include:

- Understanding how gRPC uses HTTP/2 features for improved performance.
- Implementing and using Protocol Buffers for data serialization.
- Configuring and running gRPC servers and clients in a microservices setup.
- Exploring gRPC's streaming capabilities for real-time data processing.

### Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome, especially from those looking to enhance their understanding of gRPC and microservices architectures.
